# OOP-with-cpp
# 🌟 OOP with C++ – Learn by Example!

Welcome to my personal practice repository where I explore and demonstrate key **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts using **C++**.

This repo is specially built for:
- 📘 Students learning C++ OOP concepts
- 🧠 Beginners looking for hands-on code
- 🛠️ Anyone who prefers to learn by *doing* rather than reading theory

## 🧩 What's Inside?

Each folder in this repository covers a core topic of OOP in C++:

| Folder | Topic | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `01-Classes-Objects/` | Classes & Objects | Basic class structure, object creation |
| `02-Constructors/` | Constructors & Destructors | Parameterized, default, copy constructors |
| `03-Inheritance/` | Inheritance | Single, multiple, multilevel examples |
| `04-Polymorphism/` | Polymorphism | Compile-time (overloading), Runtime (virtual) |
| `05-Encapsulation/` | Encapsulation | Access specifiers, data hiding |
| `06-FileHandling/` | OOP + Files | File streams with classes |
| `07-Practice-Projects/` | Mini Projects | Real-life scenarios using OOP design |

Each folder contains:
- ✨ Well-commented source code (`.cpp` files)
- 🧾 Optional README with theory + code explanation
- ✅ Output sample (sometimes!)
- 💡 Real-world relatable examples

## 🎯 Why I Made This

As a student, I noticed that many tutorials were either too simple or too complex. This repo aims to be the middle ground — *just enough theory*, backed by *working code*, and *clear folder organization*.

My goal: **Help students learn OOP in a practical and joyful way!** 😄
